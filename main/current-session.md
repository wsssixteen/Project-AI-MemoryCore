**Last Activity**: 2026-11-03 10:30 — worktree `pelupusan-1-9-1-deploy-99eee6` (branch claude/pelupusan-1-9-1-deploy-99eee6), Pelupusan 1.9.1 baseline to MR !12, Domain Expansion.

## Session Recap (2026-11-02 to 11-03, Pelupusan 1.9.1 baseline)
- Release 1.9.1: 287201, 286655, 287048, 286610 merged into mlk/release/1.9.1 (tip 3cf52efea6, common 1.10.20-MLK). BA passed baseline Pelupusan and Awam Pelupusan 2026-11-02. MR !12 to mlk/master, reviewer Alex. stag-env caught up to 7506e27958, compile green.
- Open: at 2026-11-03 10:07 origin/mlk/master is still 74982588f9, yet Redmine says "Released and ready in Prod : 02/11/2026" (Hakiim Majid) on all four. On his "merged": `node domain/release-mlk-plp/release-prep.js merge-to-master --release 1.9.1 --check` from the main folder.
- Awam stag-catchup for 1.15.1 refused: conflict in pom.xml and BaseConsentForm.java (consent changes 276583, 284760), and it would move common 1.10.19-MLK.beta.patch3 to 1.9.2-MLK. Nothing pushed. Slip row logged.
- Staging error 42342 (2026-11-02 18:56, PTMLK/01/L/MCL/2026/24, PSKN5A Selesai, null documentId): not from 1.9.1, PROD has it 4 times since July. Pembetulan branch has no null check (MlkSuratTemplateForm.java:3504-3507). Cause of the missing ID not proven. LATENT-BUGS L37. BA reply drafted.
- Quests saved at DE: 287201 + 286655 archived (Redmine Closed), 287048 Phase 1 closed (Pending User, user at a meeting), 286610 WAIT (Pending User).
- Assessment: A1 objective locks for 21 quests were injected on a "DE" prompt that named none. A2 287048's Resume Point said "Phase 0 done" while the fix was on PROD. A3 branch-guard blocked a Read on his checkout (mlk/int-env); git show on the release branch worked. A4 PROD release before master merge is not seen by release-prep. A5 ⏭ no sweep.

**Last Activity**: 2026-11-02 18:45 — worktree `ticket-287773-quest-run-66ac6f`, QA-287773 Phase 1 closed, Domain Expansion.

## Session Recap (2026-11-02, ticket 287773 PPTPB)
- Done: BA's fix, PT out of the PPTPB Agihan Kepada at Keputusan Pentadbir Tanah. Commit 193ca03bd0 on mlk/esokongan/287773, int-env 5a0906004f. Redmine posted 18:22 (journal 6): Resolved, Nurhafizah Hasan, 100%, his photo attached. Quest closed Phase 1, status WAIT until Redmine Closed.
- System landed earlier today: quest/place-file.js Tool + attachment-context reminder, quest and bpmn-check rules for the Flowable Save model Description (it replaces the old text), Pena flowable-description profile.
- Wrong: I advised the PT route from requirement 219931 on a 16:36 sync, BA wrote the opposite at 16:39. The v4 Flowable tidy left 174 of 249 arrows off the gateway diamonds, not saved. Both have slip rows; wrong-fix row 1 added.
- Open: (1) posted Solutions names KPT, his screenshot shows only PPD and KPPD, reason not verified. (2) MLIT PTMLK/03/L/PPTPB/2026/9 still with sabrina, must go back to PKPPT/suhaila. (3) MLIT engine v14 PT route undo not confirmed. All three are in the qa_doc Resume Point.
- Assessment: A1 save-quest read QUEST-STORY as MISSING for an absolute qa_doc, and the doc existed only in the worktree. A2 the Resume Point still said hold after the fix was posted. A3 Solutions text named KPT without being compared to the photo. A4 fix advice ran on a journal read 9 minutes old. A5 ⏭ no sweep run.

**Last Activity**: 2026-11-02 18:50 — worktree `sweep-orchestration-audit-39e710` (branch claude/redmine-quest-sweep-92d16e), eSOKONGAN sweep of 287346, 287509, 287607 finished, Domain Expansion.

## Session Recap (2026-11-02, eSOKONGAN sweep of 3 tickets)
- Done: 287509 commit 6c437501b8, int-env merge 49875d246c, Resolved to Amani 10:37:44Z. 287607 commit bf6dfc84e6, int-env merge c32e2e894b, Resolved to Fizah 10:37:45Z, Phase 1 closed. miya built and tested both on internal: "Tests passed, post". 287346 answered "tidak sama" to BA Anis and passed to her, no code. General rule landed: eSOKONGAN means Tracker, never Project.
- Not done: neither fix is on the planned-release list. 287346 waits on Anis. Redmine reconcile shows 287747, 287350 and 287164 assigned to him with no open block; not opened here.
- Told only now: stag-catchup was not run for Awam, because it would lower internal's common pin to 1.9.2-MLK. Written in QA-287607.
- Wrong: my replies ran long with no diagram and he had to tell me to answer like a human. My first 287346 brief did not lead with the BA's question, and he had to ask whether I checked it. I had checked it; the answer was buried.
- Assessment: A1 after compaction the handover text lived only in chat, recovered from the transcript. A2 287509 and 287607 sit in the same state and got different save verdicts from their local status alone. A3 ⏭ no debugging; both fixes passed on the first build. A4 stag-catchup would have lowered a higher internal pin. A5 the sweep close table has no row for a question the BA asked.
